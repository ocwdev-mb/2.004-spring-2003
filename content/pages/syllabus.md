Practice Sessions
-----------------

The purpose of the practice sessions will be to give students experience in modeling and computational aspects of dynamics by working out examples, expanding on the material presented in the lectures. Part of the weekly homework will relate to these examples. Attendance in the practice sessions is obligatory.

Laboratory
----------

Participation in the weekly laboratory session is an integral part of the course and attendance is obligatory. Assignment of students to one of the four sections will be completed during the first week of classes. No changes will be allowed after this time.

Homework
--------

Homework problems will be assigned each week (typically on Friday) and will be due at the time indicated on each problem set (typically one week later). No late homework will be accepted. You may discuss the problems with others in class, but you must (a) write up your eventual solution independently, and (b) list the names of students with whom you discussed the problem set.

Text
----

None required. Optional reading assignments from these books will be given periodically:
